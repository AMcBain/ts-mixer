# ts-mixer
It seems that no one has been able to provide an acceptable way to gracefully implement
the mixin pattern with TypeScript.  The "mixins" as described by the
[TypeScript docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/mixins.html) are horrendous.
Countless online threads feature exasperated developers who just want a mixin pattern that
"works".

My fruitless search has led me to believe that there is no currently available solution
without compromises.  Instead, I present a "tolerable" solution that attempts to take the
best from the many different flawed implementations while mitigating their flaws as much
as possible.

**More info to come...**
